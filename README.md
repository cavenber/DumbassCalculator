# Welcome to Dumbass Calculator

### About:

This is a personal project that I used to help make math easier to understand and use in my daily life. Feel free to use it if you find it helpful :)

### How to Use Dumbass Calculator:

Run the `start.py` file with any python compiler and type 'help' for further assistance

If it cannot detect the other necessary files required for it to work, make sure you gave the compiler access to said files
