its a calculator i made during my first year of college when i first learned python. i kept updating it with new calculations and functions with all that was needed through out my college math and programming classes which become what it is now.
feel free to use it if you find it useful and provide feedback. although keep in mind this is primarly a personal project therefore i do whatever i want lol

instructions on how to use it:
run the start script with anything that can run python code
and read what it says lol
